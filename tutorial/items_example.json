EBITDA grew 13% YoY (14% miss) to INR3.2b and margin expanded 170bp YoY to 37.7%, led by currency benefits and better product mix. PAT grew 12% YoY to INR2.5b, aided by INR30m forex gain and lower than expected depreciation. DIVI trades at 27x FY16E, 23x FY17E and 18x FY18E (P/E), at par with historical average. Large capex addition and growing contribution of API generics are likely put margins under check. However, strong balance sheet (net cash) and high return ratios (RoE at ~29%) provide valuation cushion. We retain our Neutral stance and estimates.

The airline originally was looking to hit the capital market in the current financial year, which has also seen budget carrier IndiGo's blockbuster IPO. Sources said that GoAir is still awaiting clarity on the delivery of 72 Airbus A320 neo planes before taking a final decision on the timing of the IPO.\r\nThe delivery of the aircraft was to start from April this year. While the Wadia group airline has not officially made its IPO plan public, sources said GoAir would be looking to raise around USD 150-175 million. At current exchange rate, this would translate into Rs 1,000 to 1,200 crore.\r\nApart from aircraft delivery schedule, GoAir would also be taking into account market conditions before deciding on the IPO timing, sources said. GoAir's ambitious fleet expansion plans have taken a hit with European aircraft maker Airbus recently indicating a potential delay in the delivery schedule for A320 Neos due to some \"industrial reasons\". The airline was supposed to have 26 Airbus A320 neos by end of 2017.\r\nIn June 2011, it had placed order for 72 new A320 neos, valued at about Rs 32,400 crore on list price, with Airbus. Currently, GoAir has 19 A320s in the fleet operating 144 daily flights across 22 domestic destinations. The IPO would help the carrier raise funds for international operations, which it would start after having a fleet of minimum 20 planes.\r\nUnder existing regulations, domestic carriers can fly overseas only if they have at least five years of operational experience and a minimum of 20 aircraft. Once it comes out with the IPO, GoAir would be the fifth local airline to get listed after  Jet Airways  ,  SpiceJet   and IndiGo. Kingfisher, which was listed, grounded its operations in December 2012.\r\nIn October last year, IndiGo's parent  InterGlobe Aviation   mopped up little over Rs 3,000 crore through its IPO.$(\"<div class='CL'></div>\").insertAfter(\".clear_cls\") ", "date_published": "08 Feb,2016 0951hrs IST", "image_url": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news_image_files/2014/356x200/g/goair_airline_256_0618_356.jpg", "description": "The airline originally was looking to hit the capital market in the current financial year, which has also seen budget carrier IndiGo's blockbuster IPO.
