Hemen Kapadia of KRChoksey SecuritiesPipavav DefenceAs of now  Pipavav Defence   would be a hold. I wouldn\u2019t have a five year view simply because I have data of five years. In this five years it has moved between Rs 30 on the downside Rs 120 on the upside without any directional bias, so honestly speaking we have gone nowhere. As of now it is oversold.\u00a0A bounce seems to be on the anvil, so I would suggest a hold with a stoploss of Rs 52. Sharmila Joshi of sharmilajoshi.comBerger PaintsWe have seen  Berger Paints   at Rs 215-220 levels for the longest time and we saw it make that break in November-December when it went to Rs 270-280 kind of level. The logic is pretty much clear, it is because crude is in this kind of trajectory though it is sort of stabilised last couple of weeks, so I do expect it to go lower and stay in this range. So given that the profit margins for Berger Paints or any of the paint companies will remain good but the trick lies in the topline because we are not seeing any demand pick up.\u00a0If you were in a situation where crude prices were lower and you saw demand pick up then paint companies would be the space to be in, but I still think that if you want a play which takes advantage of lower crude prices then paints is one sector. So one should stay put especially if one has a year's outlook.Pipavav Defence  Pipavav Defence   move from Rs 30 to Rs 120, Rs 120 was when euphoria must be high as that you will see big orders coming to Indian companies. Now because of the way markets are and because of the fact that we haven\u2019t seen too much of that getting translated into real orders be little cautious because there is nothing else in the fundamentals to suggests why the stocks should even be at Rs 64.\u00a0Let see what the Budget says, let us see in the next three-four months if anything of that happens in the mean time if you see a bit of a bounce in midcap space and you get an exit price use it. Unless of course some material development as happened in the mean time. So, I would sell but for a five year view maybe one can stay put because there was stock of defence orders and we really haven\u2019t seen that happening.HCC We have seen this entire sector beaten down and if you are talking of like a two year view may be things can happen in these two years. You can see infra companies do better. My advice will be to switch from  Hindustan Construction Company  \u00a0(HCC) because it make a lot more sense to switch to a company where earnings are already decent and they are not so leveraged.\u00a0You can look at an  IRB Infra   or  Sadbhav Engineering  . We have heard a lot of road orders being awarded and both these companies are within that space. So, it might be a slightly safer bet within the infra space. However, as space it is beaten down, so just consider switching to another stock in the infra space if you want to remain there.Strides Shasun There is no getting away from the fact that pharmaceutical as a space has become quite volatile given the fact that we are seeing a lot more action from USFDA and lot more inspections and comments etc.  Strides Shasun   again has been volatile and the results have been good this quarter.\u00a0They seem to be acquiring companies apart from of course the Shasun bid that they acquired. So, overall Strides is on a strong wicket and if one is patient then he/she will definitely get to see high levels from here. However, what we must bear in mind is that possibly next year \u2013 year and a half it would be a little volatile for pharmaceutical stocks. So, if one is willing to ride that out then I would suggest that one stays put.$(\"<div class='CL'></div>\").insertAfter(\".clear_cls\") ", "date_published": "2016-02-18 15:52:00", "image_url": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news_image_files/2016/356x200/h/Hold_buy_sell_budget_2016_356x200_4818_356.jpg", "description": "Watch the interview of Hemen Kapadia of KRChoksey Securities & Sharmila Joshi of Sharmilajoshi.com who shared their readings and outlook on specific stocks and sector.", "title": "Your stocks: Investment ideas by market experts  - Moneycontrol.com"},

The stock ended 20 percent down at the closing on Thursday.\u00a0 The company raised Rs 451 crore through its initial public offer (IPO) last week, which consisted of fresh issue of Rs 250 crore and an offer for sale of about 62.70 lakh equity shares by promoters Kailash Sahebrao Katkar and Sanjay Sahebrao Katkar, as well as investor Sequoia Capital India Investment Holdings III.Kailash Katkar, MD & CEO of the company says that Quick Heal is in process of developing a number of enterprise security products and the funds raised will be utilized for further development and marketing of the products.  The company has received Rs 56 crore tax demand from the Income Tax department for certain products. The demand, Katkar says is baseless as the products are manufactured in excise-free regions.The company has not done any provisioning for the same, he adds. Going forward, Katkar expects improvement in margins. Below is the transcript of Kailash Katkar\u2019s interview with CNBC-TV18's Anuj Singhal, Reema Tendulkar and Sonia Shenoy.Anuj: Before we talk about the complain issue the first thing I want to know from you is why do you go for Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the first place. Because out of Rs 450 crore the fresh issue was Rs 250 crore. But you already had cash in hand of about Rs 100 crore and even the forthcoming cash flow was likely to be good. So, what was the need for the IPO in the first place?A: I understand your question. Going for IPO and having a primary in company was for new product development and taking that product to the market. So, Quick Heal Technologies is definitely known by anti-virus company in a big way but we have already started developing lot of enterprise security products and we wanted to take these products to all customers. We have also created a separate brand for this enterprise security products by name Seqrite and we wanted to take this product to the market and we wanted to increase the R&D for developing more enterprise products and other Mobile Device Management (MDM) products.Sonia: The bigger issue that the market is a bit worried about is the fact that SEBI has sent a notice to investors about a service tax of Rs 56 crore that you have to pay and additional penalty of another Rs 56 crore along with interest. Is this correct, is this amount something that the company has to pay out?A: I will say this that the company has received the order from service tax department but if I have to answer your question directly put it in a brief way that when this product came under excise in year 2006 from that day we are paying excise on Quick Heal range of products. When we thought of when this product as an excise product we took this manufacturing part of it to excise free zone that is Rudrapur and Himachal Pradesh and the day when we shifted our manufacturing process to the excise free zone now the department wants service tax on that product. But from my point of view this is fundamentally not right. I believe in Indian legal justice and I wanted to take this to next level and I am 100 percent sure the case is very strong.Sonia: But even if you contest it, if suppose you have to go ahead and make that service tax payment instead of the Value Added Tax (VAT) payment that you used to make earlier then what could the impact be on your net profits margin because the service tax that you will have to pay will be 14 percent?A: Yes, today it is at 14 percent. At that given time it was not at 14 percent, it was less but I am 100 percent sure that I will be able to click this. Because the case is very strong. I have taken an opinion advice from a big lawyer from across India, not from one lawyer but I have taken it from multiple expert people.Sonia: So, are you trying to say that Mr Manohar Malani was not allotted 20,000 shares of Quick Heal Technologies in the year 2000?A: Not at all. You can come to my office and check all the books.Sonia: How do you want to respond to that because even if you are saying that these arguments are baseless it does not send a good signal out to the market and to other investors?A: I understand your question but let me tell you one thing I didn\u2019t receive any information from investor about the cheque details and his deposit details.Reema: Have you made any provision up until now of this Rs 56 crore of the tax demand which has been made on the company because while filing the red herring prospectus (RHP) you did have a show cause notice? So, in the financial up until now has any provision being made and will you be making it while this case is under litigation?A: We have not made any provision for this service tax and the auditors have also accepted the fact that the product doesn\u2019t come under service tax.Reema: The demand also talks about an interest component, a service tax demand of Rs 56 crore additional penalty of Rs 56 plus interest. Could you quantify what that interest amount is for us?A: That cannot be determined because I haven\u2019t gone through the interest part of it. I will have to sit and understand that part of it. When I knew that it is not, even auditors are supporting me, my consultants are supporting me and I haven\u2019t met any provision for that.Sonia: You haven\u2019t given us any numbers. The stock is down almost 18 percent just tell us do you expect your margins to be under further pressure because margins have come down from 50 percent couple of years back to 30 percent any more margin pressure that you are expecting?A: No. We are a product company and in product the margins are always high. One thing here is the business is seasonal business. Every quarter is going to perform in a different way. Usually all product companies performs in that way only.Yes, profits have come down because we have invested that amount in to development of a new product which delivers to our customer also. There are additional products which are in developing stage.

The company\u2019s overall financial performance except LSI sales were in line with our estimates as Jubilant has been benefitting from ramp up in CMO, volume growth in US generics (through new launches), price rise in Specialty intermediates and better realisations in Nutritional products. LSI revenues were impacted due to lower price of pyridines (due to pass on benefits of lower price of crude oil derivatives) and lower demand of pyridines and life science chemicals (LSC) from global agro\u2010chemical customers. The Pharma division sales grew by 4% YoY, while LSI\u2019s business declined by 12% as lower solvent prices (derivatives of Crude oil) drove down both input prices as well as end products. Overall, Jubilant maintained sequential EBITDA margin of Pharma at 30% while it reduced by 100bps to 15.5% in LSI in Q3FY16. With growing utilisation of CMO plants and flexibility in PPES business, we expect Jubilant\u2019s sales growth to get further boost in FY17E and FY18E. The full benefit of CMO, however, will be realised in 2\u20103 years as guided by management. Lower crude and ethanol prices to maintain 15\u201016% LSI margin in FY16E\u201018E with Pharma to maintain EBITDA margin at 30% on higher Radiopharma sales.

Although the company increased its capacity specifically in metformin, during the current quarter, it did not have any impact on revenue as most of it is exported to nations in Africa and Middle East which have witnessed a demand slowdown due to decline in crude oil prices. Thus exports for the company witnessed a double digit decline. Slowdown is particularly observed in case of governments of many of these nations who are curbing imports and depleting their inventories. However domestic revenues which form 60% of the overall topline, recorded double digit growth. EBITDA at INR 43.1cr is lower by 1% YoY and is 6% below our estimate of INR 45.8cr. EBITDA margins at 16.3% were 60bp lower YoY. PAT at INR 17.0cr declined 23% YoY which is 10% below our estimate of INR 18.9cr. Higher tax rate of 25% in the current quarter against 16% in 3QFY15 impacted PAT growth. PBT growth stood at -13%. The company is likely to witness gradual improvement in topline growth from 4QFY16 onwards when it starts the sale of high value products initially in the anti-diarrheal and anti-diabetic segment viz. metformin and later in anti-biotics. We believe FY17E topline growth will recover to 15% which should translate into 22% growth in profits on the back of higher operating leverage. Aarti Drugs is a high quality proxy play on the pharma industry. The company is climbing higher in the API value chain by selectively expanding into those APIs which are being currently imported and are of higher value. Based on the below expected performance in 3QFY16, we reduce our earnings estimates for the company by 11%/ 17% for FY16/17E. Despite this we expect the company to grow its profits at 20% CAGR over FY16-18E.

The CMP is INR 83, where INR 22 will be received from the Power transmission business in next 3-4 months due to demerger which will reduce cost to INR 61 respectively and gives an upside of 102 % from current levels.\nFor all recommendations,  click here   Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Other income traction boosted by Pru Life stake sale (one-off gains) and contained operating costs stood as savings grace. Steel sector issues and impact of RBI\u2019s fresh guidelines signal more pain for ICICI Bank in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, lack of clarity on stressed assets ensure weakness in ICICI Bank stock ahead.It seems a bumpy ride for ICICI Bank ahead especially in the light of the new RBI directive and the bank\u2019s meaningful exposure to the leveraged corporate and troubled sectors of the economy. While no complaints on loan book growth that was primarily driven by retail loan traction so also robust non-interest income that proved as the sole savings grace for the bank during the quarter, the slippages and credit costs are expected to stand higher for the forthcoming quarter.

The company\u2019s overall financial performance except LSI sales were in line with our estimates as Jubilant has been benefitting from ramp up in CMO, volume growth in US generics (through new launches), price rise in Specialty intermediates and better realisations in Nutritional products. LSI revenues were impacted due to lower price of pyridines (due to pass on benefits of lower price of crude oil derivatives) and lower demand of pyridines and life science chemicals (LSC) from global agro\u2010chemical customers. The Pharma division sales grew by 4% YoY, while LSI\u2019s business declined by 12% as lower solvent prices (derivatives of Crude oil) drove down both input prices as well as end products. Overall, Jubilant maintained sequential EBITDA margin of Pharma at 30% while it reduced by 100bps to 15.5% in LSI in Q3FY16. With growing utilisation of CMO plants and flexibility in PPES business, we expect Jubilant\u2019s sales growth to get further boost in FY17E and FY18E. The full benefit of CMO, however, will be realised in 2\u20103 years as guided by management.

Although the company increased its capacity specifically in metformin, during the current quarter, it did not have any impact on revenue as most of it is exported to nations in Africa and Middle East which have witnessed a demand slowdown due to decline in crude oil prices. Thus exports for the company witnessed a double digit decline. Slowdown is particularly observed in case of governments of many of these nations who are curbing imports and depleting their inventories. However domestic revenues which form 60% of the overall topline, recorded double digit growth. EBITDA at INR 43.1cr is lower by 1% YoY and is 6% below our estimate of INR 45.8cr. EBITDA margins at 16.3% were 60bp lower YoY. PAT at INR 17.0cr declined 23% YoY which is 10% below our estimate of INR 18.9cr. Higher tax rate of 25% in the current quarter against 16% in 3QFY15 impacted PAT growth. PBT growth stood at -13%.

We lower our EPS estimate by 8.5% for FY16e and 7.1% for FY17e to factor in the tepid Q3FY16 performance. We expect revenue CAGR of 18% over FY15\u201018e, with an adjusted profit CAGR of 28.8% and EBITDA margin expansion of 280bps to 15.8%. The stock is currently trading at 18.6x FY17e EPS. Our revised target price is Rs4,844 based upon 22xFY17e (previously Rs4,977). At our price target, MSIL would trade at a cash PE 15x FY17e (currently trades at 12.7x).

Confidence stems from strong deal wins (total contract value: USD 120 mn) in CY15 which lends revenue visibility. However, margin will be similar to CY15 (EBITDA: ~17%). Hexaware\u2019s strategy, \"Shrink IT, Grow Digital\" is targeted at large clients and has seen early signs of success around IMS, BPO and Testing in its recent wins.

MSIL was the showstopper with its Vitarra Brezza and new concept Ignis, whereas Honda and TTMT also showcased some promising products. While the expo was largely a non-event for 2Ws, HMSI, TVS and UM did come up with new launches, and HMCL with more refreshes. In all, we think 4Ws will be driven by new products in 2016, with more novel, energy-efficient, and competitively-priced models on offer. The stage is also set for a 2W recovery in FY17, with a low base and multiple triggers ahead. For 2W players, the expo was a non-event with only refreshes of products, particularly for HMSI (Splendor I smart), though TVS did showcase its Victor bike and concept Akula 310 (likely launch from BMW collaboration), and BMW its G310 bike. BJAUT/RE were conspicuous by their absence, though both have already launched their new products V/Himalayan before the expo. HMSI however was one of the few 2W player\u2019s to launch a new product, and unveiled Navi \u2013 an automatic scooter + motorcycle at Rs 39,000. While the product targets the youth, we found its positioning a bit confusing. A key surprise was UM Motorcycles foraying into India with the launch of Renegade Commando at Rs 159,000-169,000. While the bike looks promising, UM\u2019s limited network and initial capacity of 3000/month is unlikely to move rivals.

In fact European operations have shown double the increase in the EBIT. So, Apollo Tyres is the direct, is the worst stock facing the Chinese threat, because we have the Chinese threat in the truck tyres segment. It is not there in the two-wheelers while\u00a0Ceat is the least affected.\"\u00a0\"Maybe if you want to have the pecking order, probably Apollo Tyres is the worst, then  JK Tyre  \u00a0and\u00a0 MRF  . So, we all knew that these kind of problems are going to be faced by the tyre industry, so taking that into consideration, I do not think that Apollo Tyres' results should be taken in as a big disappointment. If you take a sequential call on the Q3 over Q2 because Q2 was a clear acceptance that yes, things are going bad for their European operations. India is having a big threat.\"\"Europe has vastly shown a good improvement in the working, but yes, Indian operations are continue to languish because of the Chinese threat.\"$(\"<div class='CL'></div>\").insertAfter(\".clear_cls\") ", "date_published": "2016-02-10 10:25:00", "image_url": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news_image_files/2015/356x200/b/britannia1_2158_356.jpg"},

BSE had late last month sought approval from capital markets regulator Sebi for launching the IPO, saying it is in compliance with all the requirements for the listing.\r\nThe exchange has been seeking to get listed for a long time but necessary clearances have not been forthcoming on one or the other issue. While the rival National Stock Exchange (NSE) plan for an IPO seems to have stuck as it is pitching hard for self-listing but Sebi is believed to be firm on its rule that only allows cross-listing of stock exchanges. On the other hand, BSE has no problem with cross-listing.\r\nIn 2012, BSE had hired 14 investment banks, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, Barclays, UBS, Kotak Mahindra Capital, ICICI Securities, Edelweiss Capital, Axis Capital and IIFL for its public issue. In a letter written to Sebi last month, BSE said that it is in full compliance with the requirements of the new SECC (stock exchanges and clearing corporations) Regulations and therefore it can proceed with its IPO plans. The exchange had requested Sebi to provide approval \"permitting BSE to proceed with the IPO and listing of BSEs shares on a recognised stock exchange\".\r\nSebi, in January, had amended the existing SECC regulations to make it easier for stock exchanges to list their shares through an IPO. The move follows demand from investors in stock exchanges for listing of the bourses which can provide them an opportunity to unlock the value of their investments.

Stoploss should be below Rs 262 and targets would be Rs 278 and Rs 282.\nGaurav Bissa of LKP Securities\r\nMy first recommendation today is a buy on  Pidilite Industries  . The stock has been trading in a range last few weeks, even few months. It was relatively stable as compared to some of the other midcaps which witnessed significant battering when it was seen plunging. I would recommend going long for target of Rs 625 and one can have a stoploss at Rs 585. My second recommendation is a buy on  SKS Microfinance  . The stock has seen consistent short covering; a very positive sign for the stock and this has been followed by fresh longs. It is one of the very beautiful patterns for the derivative part. It makes a good case for going long. For a short-term target of Rs 585 which if held can lead to another 30-40 points move from those levels. One can have a small stoploss at Rs 555 and go long in the stock.\nAshish Kyal of wavesstrategy.com\r\nIf you look at the charts of  Asian Paints  , this stock has continued to outperform when the volatility in the overall market has increased.

EBITDA remained flat y-o-y but increased 12.2% q-o-q to Rs 21,690 mn. EBITDA margin decreased 61 bps y-o-y but increased 235 bps q-o-q to 30.6% during 3Q FY16, exceeding our expectations for the quarter, mainly due to lower than expected Cost of Goods Sold and Employee benefits expense as a percentage of revenues.

Net margin increased 1439 bps y-o-y and 391 bps q-o-q to 20.1% in 3Q FY16, exceeding our expectation mainly due to better than expected performance at operating level further enhanced by lower than expected tax expense.Though Sun Pharma continues to face integration issue with Ranbaxy, negatively impacting the company\u2019s profitability, profitability of the company is improving with the help of Taro\u2019s performance and improvement in US business. Research & Development (R&D) expense is expected to remain high due to expense related to development of MK-3222 (Tildrakizumab), an investigational therapeutic antibody candidate, which is currently being evaluated in Phase 3 registration trials for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, a skin ailment. We continue to believe that profitability will be negatively impacted by cost associated not only with integration of Ranbaxy but also remediation efforts at Halol, Mohali, Devas, Poanta Sahib and Toansa facilities. However, Sun Pharma Management has indicated that it expects to approach US FDA for re-inspection of Halol plant during 1Q FY17. Also, the company has successfully launched generic Gleevac on 1 Feb 2016 and expects to garner 30% market share gradually. Management has continued to supply Doxil to other markets from Halol facility without interruption and expects to continue doing so but sales have been impacted by competition.\nFor all recommendations,  click here   Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Moreover, tax-write backs to the tune of INR 3320.4 mn proved as savings grace containing further PAT decline. While the asset quality stress for the bank is still not behind, we reckon the CASA mobilization, stable operating profits and capital augmentation plans should form key triggers to boost earnings performance going forward, retain BUY.Valuation & Recommendation: Tax write-backs during the quarter contained the acute earnings decline for Union Bank.

While the bank engages with balance sheet clean-up exercise, the credit growth appears bleak for the forthcoming quarter too.

The R&D expenditure for innovation has recorded CAGR of 68.5% from FY13 to FY15. On the other hand, advertising expenses have recorded CAGR of 32% from FY13 to FY15. The above two factors have enabled Hawkins to grow the volume sales by 6.6% in Pressure Cooker and 9.5% in Cookware in FY15. The top line of Hawkins is expected to grow at CAGR of 8.5% from FY15 to FY17E. At CMP of Rs.2666, the stock is trading at P/E of 32.7x for FY17E. With the anticipated increase in top line due to strong brand positioning, innovation and new product launches, which were favourably received by the market, with strong balance sheet & financial ratios, we expect that the consumer expenditure will further increase as the economy revives and hence there will be growth in Hawkins Cookers Ltd. top line and bottom line as well.

Although the company increased its capacity specifically in metformin, during the current quarter, it did not have any impact on revenue as most of it is exported to nations in Africa and Middle East which have witnessed a demand slowdown due to decline in crude oil prices. Thus exports for the company witnessed a double digit decline. Slowdown is particularly observed in case of governments of many of these nations who are curbing imports and depleting their inventories. However domestic revenues which form 60% of the overall topline, recorded double digit growth. EBITDA at INR 43.1cr is lower by 1% YoY and is 6% below our estimate of INR 45.8cr. EBITDA margins at 16.3% were 60bp lower YoY. PAT at INR 17.0cr declined 23% YoY which is 10% below our estimate of INR 18.9cr. Higher tax rate of 25% in the current quarter against 16% in 3QFY15 impacted PAT growth. PBT growth stood at -13%. The company is likely to witness gradual improvement in topline growth from 4QFY16 onwards when it starts the sale of high value products initially in the anti-diarrheal and anti-diabetic segment viz. metformin and later in anti-biotics. We believe FY17E topline growth will recover to 15% which should translate into 22% growth in profits on the back of higher operating leverage. Aarti Drugs is a high quality proxy play on the pharma industry. The company is climbing higher in the API value chain by selectively expanding into those APIs which are being currently imported and are of higher value. Based on the below expected performance in 3QFY16, we reduce our earnings estimates for the company by 11%/ 17% for FY16/17E. Despite this we expect the company to grow its profits at 20% CAGR over FY16-18E. We value Aarti Drugs at 18x Sep 2017E EPS which is a 20% discount to the mean multiple commanded by formulation companies and maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a target price of INR 705/share (earlier INR 800) \nFor all recommendations,  click here   Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Resultantly, EBITDA was Rs21.7bn, which was lower than expectation of Rs23.8bn, while reported profit was Rs10.2bn, which though higher 27.1% YoY, was lower than expected. We lower our EPS estimate by 8.5% for FY16e and 7.1% for FY17e to factor in the tepid Q3FY16 performance. We expect revenue CAGR of 18% over FY15\u201018e, with an adjusted profit CAGR of 28.8% and EBITDA margin expansion of 280bps to 15.8%. The stock is currently trading at 18.6x FY17e EPS. Our revised target price is Rs4,844 based upon 22xFY17e (previously Rs4,977). At our price target, MSIL would trade at a cash PE 15x FY17e (currently trades at 12.7x).

Their share in the consolidated revenues is likely to jump by 300bps by FY18E accommodated by moderate growth in standalone sales due to higher exposure in the two-wheeler market. 9MFY16 revenue has increased by 14% (YoY). Gross profit margin has significantly gone up by 160bps during this period as compared to 9MFY15 led by lower raw material costs. EBITDA margins have soared up to 8.6% in 9MFY16 as compared to 7.1% during 9MFY15. Going forward, we expect EBITDA margins to be 8.9% in FY16E and 9.1% in FY18E assuming better realizations and raw material benefits to continue. Operating profit margins are expected to be 4.8% in FY16E and is likely to get better by FY18E to 6.2%. This is because of higher depreciation impact on account of capex due to increase in stake in Minda ASEAN, additional investment of Rs.140Mn in Minda Kosei and the Mexican Plant (Euro 6Mn spread over 2015-2018) with regard to Clarton Horns, which has led the Net block as on Sep\u201915 to increase by ~Rs. 1500Mn, 37% more as compared to Mar\u201915. RoE is expected to increase to 21.8% in FY16E and further to 25.3% in FY18E from 15.4% in FY15 driven by higher top-line growth and operating efficiency. RoCE is expected to improve to 19.4% in FY16E from 12.2% in FY15 and further reach 22.7% in FY18E driven by a notable push in gross profit margins in the recent quarters and also we have assumed the loan books to reduce. At CMP of Rs.753, Minda Industries Ltd is currently trading at 8.6x FY18E EPS. We value the company at P/E 10.1x for FY18E EPS for a target price of Rs.881 based on the company\u2019s future prospects. We, therefore, initiate coverage on Minda Industries Ltd with a \u201cBUY\u201d rating for a target price of Rs. 881 representing an upside potential of 17% in a 12-15 month period. \nFor all recommendations,  click here   Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Gaurang Shah of Geojit BNP Paribas Adani Port In this kind of a market you need to be careful what you are buying in case if you are buying it from a short to medium term. And if you are buying stocks which have been under pressure, my sense is that you may end up on the losing side. So, in case if you want to exit from here and of course you have got a whole host of events lined up today, the last day or the next week we come back we face the expiry and the week after that we will face the Budget. So, our sense is that at least for the next week or 10-15 days the markets are going to be extremely choppy.\u00a0One may use any kind of pull back on the higher side to lighten up  Adani Port   and if you are looking at it from a long term point of view then our advice would be to look at private sector banking which has corrected. From a long term, private sector banks looks quite attractive. Even something in autos like Tata Motors DVR, Tata Motors look quite promising to me from a long term point of view. So, use pull back to lighten up these kind of stocks.Tata Elxsi Good time to get into the Tata Group stock but you need to identify what you are buying and not only Tata Group, there are other companies in the IT sector which have been well managed and has created value over a period of time. So, with that perspective and given that  Tata Elxsi   has run up quite a bit, you might see some kind of volatility, so you need to stay away from that kind of volatility.\u00a0In our view, Infosys or HCL Technologies, either of these companies may turn out to be a better investment idea from a long-term point of view and it may actually create great value for you. As a disclosure, we do have positive coverage on both of them, so my advice would be to buy either  Infosys   or  HCL Technologies  .Century Textiles One does expect some kind of recovery post the big event in form of Budget once it is done and dusted with and if the Finance Minister has to deliver some pleasantries, so don\u2019t sell it out at current levels. Wait out;  Century Textiles   is down because the entire market is down and so is the markets globally, so you don\u2019t need to worry about that.\u00a0The problem is from a long-term point of view whether it is advisable to stay invested in this stock. There have been a lot of news flows surrounding this particular company. In case if you want to say with the textile sector, our preference would be  Arvind  . This is one particular stock which has delivered consistent numbers and the outlook looks quite positive in terms of their business. So, if you want to stay in the textile, maybe something like a Arvind is preferable. So, you can lighten up on Century Textile at any kind of pullback.\u00a0In case if you want to make a shift from here and look at a relatively safer bet, then maybe  Sun Pharmaceutical   or  Lupin   from the pharmaceutical pack or in the IT space,  HCL Technologies   or  Infosys  ; this is the broad preference that I can suggest.HPCL I would say hold on to  Hindustan Petroleum Corporation   (HPCL). There is a lot of to and fro as far as the output is concerned from OPEC whether to maintain a January level or not. Iran on the flip side has had a hard stand. They are not willing to budge as far as the output is concerned. In fact they wanted to increase their output from 5 lakh barrels per day to maybe 8-8.5 lakh barrels per day.\u00a0As a disclosure, we do have a positive coverage on HPCL and  BPCL  . From a long-term point of view, our target stands at about Rs 1,000-1,050 on HPCL and our guess is that after this initial boil that you are seeing on the crude oil, once the dust settles down and the noise subsidies you could possibly see oil again heading lower which is the best case scenario for oil marketing companies. Ashish Kyal of wavesstrategy.comMan Industries Man Industries   has bounced back from Rs 45 and rallied towards Rs 125 till September last year but then it again started crashing down and it is now substantially lower back towards Rs 50 levels. I would suggest to definitely be out of the stock like this. So any pullback from here should be used as an exit opportunity because it doesn\u2019t make sense to be with this stock that has been underperforming for almost eight years now and it is better to invest in something in stocks like probably  Asian Paints  , which has been doing exceptionally good, something like  Ashok Leyland   that has been outperforming the overall sell off that we have seen over the past few days and week.\u00a0So I think it is better to be with the largecaps and that too with the outperforming stocks rather than something like this that has been all over the places over past many years.Suzlon Energy Even last week,  Suzlon Energy   has been all over the places. It moved from Rs 9 to Rs 35-36. It then crashed back towards Rs 11, it then moved again towards Rs 28 and now it is again back to Rs 12. So I would suggest staying back with a stock that has been moving in this fashion is absolutely not a good investment. It is better to be moving out of a stock like this with such a high volatility and no clear direction, no clear trend and it has been also moving below its important moving averages.\u00a0It is better to stay out with Suzlon and invest in other largecap companies probably something like  Tata Consultancy Services   (TCS) or something like  Asian Paints  ,  Ashok Leyland  . So any rallies towards the level of Rs 17-18 should be a good exit price and on the downside one can probably use Rs 11 as a very strict stoploss for the existing position.L&T If the horizon is one year, then one should hold  Larsen and Toubro   (L&T). It has corrected sharply from the levels of Rs 1,850 to these low of around Rs 1,000. Over the past few days, we have seen some kind of bounce back activity, which is happening and the stock has now arrived again towards the 50-days moving average.\u00a0It is going to be very crucial for it to cross above Rs 1,200, which is the resistance zone. So, if it manages to cross above Rs 1,200 then we can see the levels of Rs 1,350 or Rs 1,400 on upside. So, one can hold this stock from a year's perspective, but one has to apply a stoploss which should be near Rs 950. If this stock crosses or closes below Rs 950, I am not sure where it is headed. So, use Rs 950 as a very strict stoploss and there can be some reversal or buying activity which might be emerging in this stock after a long time.$(\"<div class='CL'></div>\").insertAfter(\".clear_cls\") ", "date_published": "2016-02-19 16:11:00", "image_url": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news_image_files/2016/356x200/b/Budget2016_India_GDP_Growth_inflation_rise_Inflation_investing_slide_356x200_4815_356.jpg"},

Motilal Oswal expects a blended excise duty increase of 10 percent. Higher-than-expected excise hikes may impact already dampened cigarette volumes. Cigarette industry is already facing a crunch in volume in last few quarters due to multiple excise duty hike initiated by the government for four consecutive years.\u00a0 In FY15-16, excise duty was hiked 25 percent in cigarette lengths less than 65mm and 15 percent increased for lengths over 65 mm. According to Motilal Oswal,\u00a0 ITC may\u00a0implement a weighted average price hike of 10-11 percent\u00a0to pass on the excise duty increase. It adds that in such a scenario, cigarette volumes may decline\u00a08-10 percent\u00a0in FY17.Kotak says Budget FY17 may see moderate rise of 5-10 percent in excise duties on cigarettes. \"If duty hike is in line with our expectations, we would expect the impact on ITC to be positive. A 15 percent hike in duties shall have a negative sentimental impact; however, we believe the same is factored into the price as of now,\" it adds in a report. ITC\u2019s key product tobacco-based items mainly cigarette sales volume saw a moderate decline in December quarter to 4.5 percent after four quarters of double digit declines. ITC\u2019s cigarette sales volume has fallen over 20 percent in the last three years due to steep increases in taxation and subsequent price hikes.After Q3 results, analysts were, however, hopeful of growth in cigarette volumes. Jefferies had said that low single-digit decline in cigarette volumes was better than beaten-down expectations and likely indicates a bottoming out of demand. According to Jefferies, revival in overall consumption trends should kick start cigarette volume recovery for ITC in due course.Macquarie also said that while cigarette volume outlook will continue to depend on excise duty changes in the Union Budget, after three years of decline in volumes, the base has become favourable for volume growth in cigarettes.At 11:39 hrs ITC was quoting at Rs 297.60, down Rs 7.25, or 2.38 percent on the BSE.Follow @ NasrinzStory $(\"<div class='CL'></div>\").insertAfter(\".clear_cls\") ", "date_published": "2016-02-22 14:22:00", "image_url": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news_image_files/2015/356x200/c/cigarettes_smoking_1_4412_356.jpg"},

I think we believe that this bold move would lead to the steel companies taking a price hike of at least between USD 60 and USD 90 per tonne on the HRC, which is 17 percent hike. They can go ahead and take a higher hike but we believe that the presence of excess capacity in the industry as well as the comparative intensity will ensure that they will not be able to take the entire hike.\"\"At the same time, the hike to 17-20 percent on various products has the potential to be a game changer for the steel industry. In addition to that, we believe that by end of February or early March, the industry also might go and apply for anti-dumping measures which in itself will take some time to come. However, in the interim for a six months period to start with, this is a very big boost that the government has given to the steel sector. This has the potential in our view to change the continuous pessimism that one is seeing on the street in case of the metal stocks,\" he said.\"We believe that certain names like  Jindal Steel & Power   or  JSW Steel   should be looked at with a medium-term perspective.  Tata Steel   also would be a beneficiary.

Some of the leading private sector banks like  ICICI Bank  , from the conference call, this quarter, ICICI Bank being asked about what is the percentage of total steel loans, which are under stress category, NPA restructured and if I am not wrong, the number given out with around 20 percent. So that is a symptomatic of the kind of stress that the banking space has faced on the steel side. So there will be a huge relief for many of the bank companies and I expect a strong bounce back to come in names like ICICI Bank and  Axis Bank  , although Axis Bank is less exposed compared to ICICI Bank.

But Katkar said the company was confident of maintaining its 17 percent revenue growth rate, adding that the cyclicality will help lift revenues in the second half.\r\nQuick Heal has a 30 percent market share in the Indian retail security software market -- with about 87 percent revenues coming from there -- but is now stepping up efforts in the enterprise segment. Quick Heal primarily operates in the Indian market.Below is the verbatim transcript of Sanjay Katkar's interview with Reema Tendulkar & Nigel D'Souza on CNBC-TV18.Nigel: Could you give us what exactly is the reason behind raising this Rs 450 crore and how exactly it is going to be used?A: Out of this Rs 450 crore, Rs 250 crore is a fresh issue and in this fresh issue, we plan to use around Rs 110 crore in business development advertisement and branding. Then we have around Rs 40 crore to be used in capacity building in R&D in terms of building our technological capacities, enhancing our labs from making products ready for other, bigger enterprises. The rest of the offerings also involve enhancing our infrastructure and rest of the thing is for general purpose.Reema: Let me ask you a bit about your margins. Your margins have consistently been coming down, FY13 - 50 percent, FY14 it came down to 43 percent. Now in the first half of FY16, your EBITDA margins are close to about 30 percent, so clearly there is a big fall in your margins, is that a trend that will continue even in the coming quarters?A: No, there are two things I can say, one is we have been at a very good margins from 50 percent. We have been dropping since we had consciously taken decision to invest our profits into R&D and come out with new product. So in last three years we have released all our enterprise products and the profits have been used in building them and all the development charges have been charged up to the balance sheet.So if you look at the last six months, the drop is because we have a seasonality -- being in the product industry, there is a seasonality, our last quarter is always highest earning quarter. So the margins will definitely be maintained and it is going up hence onwards.Reema: 30 percent that you saw in the first half is perhaps the bottom in terms of margins?A: That is right.Nigel: Could you give us some numbers in terms of what exactly is your current market share? What is your revenue outlook going ahead, do you think it will roughly be around Rs 300 crore on a per annum basis?A: Yes.Nigel: In the next year or so for FY17, what exactly could be your revenue and also break up what is your current market share?A: Currently, we are having 30 percent of a retail market share and we are just entering to enterprise segment these last three years and we are doing very good traction there and if you are asking for the targets, we will be definitely achieving the growth that we had been achieving since last three-four years. We had been at 17 percent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for last five years and I cannot speak of exact target.Nigel: You have been growing at around 20 percent. On the first half of this year, you have done only Rs 150 crore, so second half of the year is going to be much better for you?A: Yes. We have seasonality in products. So H1 is always 35-40 percent of our revenues. So second half is going to be better. $(\"<div class='CL'></div>\").insertAfter(\".clear_cls\") ", "date_published": "2016-02-08 18:01:00", "image_url": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news_image_files/2014/356x200/i/informationtechnology_16_9_0129_356.jpg"},
