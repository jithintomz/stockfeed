Hemen Kapadia of KRChoksey SecuritiesPipavav DefenceAs of now  Pipavav Defence   would be a hold. I wouldn\u2019t have a five year view simply because I have data of five years. In this five years it has moved between Rs 30 on the downside Rs 120 on the upside without any directional bias, so honestly speaking we have gone nowhere. As of now it is oversold.\u00a0A bounce seems to be on the anvil, so I would suggest a hold with a stoploss of Rs 52. Sharmila Joshi of sharmilajoshi.comBerger PaintsWe have seen  Berger Paints   at Rs 215-220 levels for the longest time and we saw it make that break in November-December when it went to Rs 270-280 kind of level. The logic is pretty much clear, it is because crude is in this kind of trajectory though it is sort of stabilised last couple of weeks, so I do expect it to go lower and stay in this range. So given that the profit margins for Berger Paints or any of the paint companies will remain good but the trick lies in the topline because we are not seeing any demand pick up.\u00a0If you were in a situation where crude prices were lower and you saw demand pick up then paint companies would be the space to be in, but I still think that if you want a play which takes advantage of lower crude prices then paints is one sector. So one should stay put especially if one has a year's outlook.Pipavav Defence  Pipavav Defence   move from Rs 30 to Rs 120, Rs 120 was when euphoria must be high as that you will see big orders coming to Indian companies. Now because of the way markets are and because of the fact that we haven\u2019t seen too much of that getting translated into real orders be little cautious because there is nothing else in the fundamentals to suggests why the stocks should even be at Rs 64.\u00a0Let see what the Budget says, let us see in the next three-four months if anything of that happens in the mean time if you see a bit of a bounce in midcap space and you get an exit price use it. Unless of course some material development as happened in the mean time. So, I would sell but for a five year view maybe one can stay put because there was stock of defence orders and we really haven\u2019t seen that happening.HCC We have seen this entire sector beaten down and if you are talking of like a two year view may be things can happen in these two years. You can see infra companies do better. My advice will be to switch from  Hindustan Construction Company  \u00a0(HCC) because it make a lot more sense to switch to a company where earnings are already decent and they are not so leveraged.\u00a0You can look at an  IRB Infra   or  Sadbhav Engineering  . We have heard a lot of road orders being awarded and both these companies are within that space. So, it might be a slightly safer bet within the infra space. However, as space it is beaten down, so just consider switching to another stock in the infra space if you want to remain there.Strides Shasun There is no getting away from the fact that pharmaceutical as a space has become quite volatile given the fact that we are seeing a lot more action from USFDA and lot more inspections and comments etc.  Strides Shasun   again has been volatile and the results have been good this quarter.\u00a0They seem to be acquiring companies apart from of course the Shasun bid that they acquired. So, overall Strides is on a strong wicket and if one is patient then he/she will definitely get to see high levels from here. However, what we must bear in mind is that possibly next year \u2013 year and a half it would be a little volatile for pharmaceutical stocks. So, if one is willing to ride that out then I would suggest that one stays put.$(\"<div class='CL'></div>\").insertAfter(\".clear_cls\") ", "date_published": "2016-02-18 15:52:00", "image_url": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news_image_files/2016/356x200/h/Hold_buy_sell_budget_2016_356x200_4818_356.jpg", "description": "Watch the interview of Hemen Kapadia of KRChoksey Securities & Sharmila Joshi of Sharmilajoshi.com who shared their readings and outlook on specific stocks and sector.", "title": "Your stocks: Investment ideas by market experts  - Moneycontrol.com"},

The stock ended 20 percent down at the closing on Thursday.\u00a0 The company raised Rs 451 crore through its initial public offer (IPO) last week, which consisted of fresh issue of Rs 250 crore and an offer for sale of about 62.70 lakh equity shares by promoters Kailash Sahebrao Katkar and Sanjay Sahebrao Katkar, as well as investor Sequoia Capital India Investment Holdings III.Kailash Katkar, MD & CEO of the company says that Quick Heal is in process of developing a number of enterprise security products and the funds raised will be utilized for further development and marketing of the products.  The company has received Rs 56 crore tax demand from the Income Tax department for certain products. The demand, Katkar says is baseless as the products are manufactured in excise-free regions.The company has not done any provisioning for the same, he adds. Going forward, Katkar expects improvement in margins. Below is the transcript of Kailash Katkar\u2019s interview with CNBC-TV18's Anuj Singhal, Reema Tendulkar and Sonia Shenoy.Anuj: Before we talk about the complain issue the first thing I want to know from you is why do you go for Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the first place. Because out of Rs 450 crore the fresh issue was Rs 250 crore. But you already had cash in hand of about Rs 100 crore and even the forthcoming cash flow was likely to be good. So, what was the need for the IPO in the first place?A: I understand your question. Going for IPO and having a primary in company was for new product development and taking that product to the market. So, Quick Heal Technologies is definitely known by anti-virus company in a big way but we have already started developing lot of enterprise security products and we wanted to take these products to all customers. We have also created a separate brand for this enterprise security products by name Seqrite and we wanted to take this product to the market and we wanted to increase the R&D for developing more enterprise products and other Mobile Device Management (MDM) products.Sonia: The bigger issue that the market is a bit worried about is the fact that SEBI has sent a notice to investors about a service tax of Rs 56 crore that you have to pay and additional penalty of another Rs 56 crore along with interest. Is this correct, is this amount something that the company has to pay out?A: I will say this that the company has received the order from service tax department but if I have to answer your question directly put it in a brief way that when this product came under excise in year 2006 from that day we are paying excise on Quick Heal range of products. When we thought of when this product as an excise product we took this manufacturing part of it to excise free zone that is Rudrapur and Himachal Pradesh and the day when we shifted our manufacturing process to the excise free zone now the department wants service tax on that product. But from my point of view this is fundamentally not right. I believe in Indian legal justice and I wanted to take this to next level and I am 100 percent sure the case is very strong.Sonia: But even if you contest it, if suppose you have to go ahead and make that service tax payment instead of the Value Added Tax (VAT) payment that you used to make earlier then what could the impact be on your net profits margin because the service tax that you will have to pay will be 14 percent?A: Yes, today it is at 14 percent. At that given time it was not at 14 percent, it was less but I am 100 percent sure that I will be able to click this. Because the case is very strong. I have taken an opinion advice from a big lawyer from across India, not from one lawyer but I have taken it from multiple expert people.Sonia: So, are you trying to say that Mr Manohar Malani was not allotted 20,000 shares of Quick Heal Technologies in the year 2000?A: Not at all. You can come to my office and check all the books.Sonia: How do you want to respond to that because even if you are saying that these arguments are baseless it does not send a good signal out to the market and to other investors?A: I understand your question but let me tell you one thing I didn\u2019t receive any information from investor about the cheque details and his deposit details.Reema: Have you made any provision up until now of this Rs 56 crore of the tax demand which has been made on the company because while filing the red herring prospectus (RHP) you did have a show cause notice? So, in the financial up until now has any provision being made and will you be making it while this case is under litigation?A: We have not made any provision for this service tax and the auditors have also accepted the fact that the product doesn\u2019t come under service tax.Reema: The demand also talks about an interest component, a service tax demand of Rs 56 crore additional penalty of Rs 56 plus interest. Could you quantify what that interest amount is for us?A: That cannot be determined because I haven\u2019t gone through the interest part of it. I will have to sit and understand that part of it. When I knew that it is not, even auditors are supporting me, my consultants are supporting me and I haven\u2019t met any provision for that.Sonia: You haven\u2019t given us any numbers. The stock is down almost 18 percent just tell us do you expect your margins to be under further pressure because margins have come down from 50 percent couple of years back to 30 percent any more margin pressure that you are expecting?A: No. We are a product company and in product the margins are always high. One thing here is the business is seasonal business. Every quarter is going to perform in a different way. Usually all product companies performs in that way only.Yes, profits have come down because we have invested that amount in to development of a new product which delivers to our customer also. There are additional products which are in developing stage.

The company\u2019s overall financial performance except LSI sales were in line with our estimates as Jubilant has been benefitting from ramp up in CMO, volume growth in US generics (through new launches), price rise in Specialty intermediates and better realisations in Nutritional products. LSI revenues were impacted due to lower price of pyridines (due to pass on benefits of lower price of crude oil derivatives) and lower demand of pyridines and life science chemicals (LSC) from global agro\u2010chemical customers. The Pharma division sales grew by 4% YoY, while LSI\u2019s business declined by 12% as lower solvent prices (derivatives of Crude oil) drove down both input prices as well as end products. Overall, Jubilant maintained sequential EBITDA margin of Pharma at 30% while it reduced by 100bps to 15.5% in LSI in Q3FY16. With growing utilisation of CMO plants and flexibility in PPES business, we expect Jubilant\u2019s sales growth to get further boost in FY17E and FY18E. The full benefit of CMO, however, will be realised in 2\u20103 years as guided by management. Lower crude and ethanol prices to maintain 15\u201016% LSI margin in FY16E\u201018E with Pharma to maintain EBITDA margin at 30% on higher Radiopharma sales.

Although the company increased its capacity specifically in metformin, during the current quarter, it did not have any impact on revenue as most of it is exported to nations in Africa and Middle East which have witnessed a demand slowdown due to decline in crude oil prices. Thus exports for the company witnessed a double digit decline. Slowdown is particularly observed in case of governments of many of these nations who are curbing imports and depleting their inventories. However domestic revenues which form 60% of the overall topline, recorded double digit growth. EBITDA at INR 43.1cr is lower by 1% YoY and is 6% below our estimate of INR 45.8cr. EBITDA margins at 16.3% were 60bp lower YoY. PAT at INR 17.0cr declined 23% YoY which is 10% below our estimate of INR 18.9cr. Higher tax rate of 25% in the current quarter against 16% in 3QFY15 impacted PAT growth. PBT growth stood at -13%. The company is likely to witness gradual improvement in topline growth from 4QFY16 onwards when it starts the sale of high value products initially in the anti-diarrheal and anti-diabetic segment viz. metformin and later in anti-biotics. We believe FY17E topline growth will recover to 15% which should translate into 22% growth in profits on the back of higher operating leverage. Aarti Drugs is a high quality proxy play on the pharma industry. The company is climbing higher in the API value chain by selectively expanding into those APIs which are being currently imported and are of higher value. Based on the below expected performance in 3QFY16, we reduce our earnings estimates for the company by 11%/ 17% for FY16/17E. Despite this we expect the company to grow its profits at 20% CAGR over FY16-18E.

So as of now, don\u2019t worry about what is happening in the market, let the storm pass by but I think HDIL, at current valuations, is one of the stocks you should stand by,\" he added.$(\"<div class='CL'></div>\").insertAfter(\".clear_cls\") ", "date_published": "2016-02-10 15:15:00", "image_url": "http://www.moneycontrol.com/news_image_files/2014/356x200/h/hdil_356_5443_356.jpg", "description": "Pankaj Jain of SW Capital is of the view that one may stay invested in Housing Development and Infrastructure (HDIL).", "title": "Hold HDIL, says Pankaj Jain  - Moneycontrol.com"},
