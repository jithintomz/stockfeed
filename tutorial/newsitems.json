Revenue growth and margin were largely impacted due to furloughs, calendar effect (lower working days), and Chennai floods. Outlook and strategy: Management is targeting to grow higher than industry (NASSCOM: 10-12%) in CY16 (Q1 and Q4 are seasonally soft quarters). Confidence stems from strong deal wins (total contract value: USD 120 mn) in CY15 which lends revenue visibility. However, margin will be similar to CY15 (EBITDA: ~17%).

{"content": ".Religares research report on Automobile sectorThe 13th Auto Expo being held in Greater Noida (5-9 Feb) seems to have set the stage for combat in relatively niche 4W segments, especially compact sedans and SUVs. MSIL was the showstopper with its Vitarra Brezza and new concept Ignis, whereas Honda and TTMT also showcased some promising products. While the expo was largely a non-event for 2Ws, HMSI, TVS and UM did come up with new launches, and HMCL with more refreshes. In all, we think 4Ws will be driven by new products in 2016, with more novel, energy-efficient, and competitively-priced models on offer. The stage is also set for a 2W recovery in FY17, with a low base and multiple triggers ahead. For 2W players, the expo was a non-event with only refreshes of products, particularly for HMSI (Splendor I smart), though TVS did showcase its Victor bike and concept Akula 310 (likely launch from BMW collaboration), and BMW its G310 bike. BJAUT/RE were conspicuous by their absence, though both have already launched their new products V/Himalayan before the expo. HMSI however was one of the few 2W player\u2019s to launch a new product, and unveiled Navi \u2013 an automatic scooter + motorcycle at Rs 39,000. While the product targets the youth, we found its positioning a bit confusing. A key surprise was UM Motorcycles foraying into India with the launch of Renegade Commando at Rs 159,000-169,000. While the bike looks promising, UM\u2019s limited network and initial capacity of 3000/month is unlikely to move rivals. Most 2W players also showcased e-bikes, including Genze/Duet E by MM/HMSI. \nFor all recommendations,  click here   Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
